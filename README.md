Chet Baker was a primary exponent of the West Coast school of cool jazz in the early and mid-’50s. As a trumpeter, he had a generally restrained, intimate playing style and he attracted attention beyond jazz for his photogenic looks and singing. The family moved from Oklahoma to Glendale, CA, in 1940. He had his first formal training in music in junior high and later at Glendale High School. Baker initially played in Vido Musso ’s band, then with Stan Getz .
